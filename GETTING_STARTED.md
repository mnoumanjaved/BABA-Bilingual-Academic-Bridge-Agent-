# Getting Started with BABA üöÄ

Welcome! Follow these simple steps to get BABA up and running.

---

## Step 1: Add Your OpenAI API Key ‚ö°

**This is the ONLY required setup step!**

1. Open the file `.env` in the BABA folder
2. Find this line:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
3. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key

**Don't have an API key yet?**
- Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Sign up or log in
- Create a new API key
- Copy and paste it into `.env`

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies üì¶

Open your terminal/command prompt in the BABA folder and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all required packages (takes 2-3 minutes).

---

## Step 3: Verify Setup (Optional but Recommended) ‚úÖ

Run the verification script to check everything is working:

```bash
python verify_setup.py
```

This will check:
- ‚úì Python version

- ‚úì API key configured
- ‚úì All files present
- ‚úì API connection working
